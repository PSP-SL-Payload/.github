# PSP-SL Payload Team
Welcome to the official organization of the PSP-SL Payload team!
The goal of this organization is to store the Payload team's software + electrical work and to ensure knowledge is passed from team to team. With this in mind, **please make sure this repo gets passed down and updated each year!**


## Organization Scheme
Make repos as needed/desired. The work of old teams will be marked LEGACY and followed by the year. Use these as guidance for future endeavors.

## Technology Preferences
### Software
The team has had great success using Arduino with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). PlatformIO makes it so much easier to develop, it is **highly** recommended you use this setup for the embedded side of things.
### Hardware
[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) has worked exceptionally well for the team. We use that for schematics and PCBs.
